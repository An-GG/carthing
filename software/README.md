# part A notes

what we really want is a similar experience to the tesla phone key but without using a custom app that has to run in the background on iOS
    - to do this with nonzero "security" we can use bluetooth pairing, so if paired device is within certain rssi 
    - need esp32 to show up in iOS's Bluetooh Settings, need to pretend to be a bluetooth audio device or something
        - Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) might be ideal if it works

```
```

```

### ~~the project is now very rapidly approaching scuffed and unmaintable code territory~~ 
its aight 


alternative:
abandon pairing, literally just use advertised device name and check rssi

> is this even reliable? even assuming no low power mode nonsense, is this always available?

# part B notes: required bt app fallback

custom ios app 
 - two buttons: lock, unlock
 - easy: connect to esp using uuid, write password + action to esp32 
 - better: 
        - use time based rolling code as the password 
        - do this with bt pairing ? how secure even is this if i dont try

## so originally
we were avoiding implementing a HID device for security / privacy reasons but the reality is

**basically any of these could be HID input and it's not really clear anyway, so**

> edit: **holy shit it literally does actually look exactly the same lmao**

>>> **ok yeah** going for security or whatever was mega low IQ decision making, should've actually looked at implementation first. *after a device is paired it can just casually become a HID device* ***and still stay paired***

it looks exactly the same to the user and ios will reconnect*. user controls initial pairing invocation after which connection is secure

#### bottom line: use whatever bt protocol its fine

still not sure how to achieve this without advertising as an audio device, hid controller/keyboard/mouse, or ~~heart rate monitor~~ [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204387](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204387)

# so for iOS

using **SwiftUI**
- admittedly really great templating syntax + beautiful defaults. if this was html i would love html.
- implemented as
    - a swift playground (compile and deploy all on ipad)
    - xcode project
 
both are swiftui with prob identical code  


 -> xcode project

**they moved the goddamn plist**

confirmed you don't need to add more than the **Privacy - Bluetooth always usage description** to the info.plist for scanning, connecting, reading/writing for the keyfob app

there's a __required__ *empty* Info.plist in the project folder, but it ___explicitly doesn't show up in the object tree___ in Xcode ????  

# ðŸ¤¡ 

thank god this was the first result on google

anywhen

 --> playgrounds project

setting up delegates for corebluetooth in swiftui from empty base class didn't work for some reason idk didn't look into it
 - required inheretence pattern was big stupid
  - ez pz with this

inhereting a UIViewController seems to work tho, **but you have to add it to the view lmao** 

# Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ 

this scuffed shit will do for now
```swift


let appvc = ScannerViewController()


class ScannerViewController: UIViewController, CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate {
    
    var centralManager: CBCentralManager!
    var peripheral: CBPeripheral!


.
.
.


class MainVC : UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        view.addSubview(appvc.view)
        appvc.view.frame = view.frame
    }
    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {
        appvc.view.frame = view.frame
    }
}

struct MyUIViewControllerRepresentable: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> MainVC {
        return MainVC()
    }
    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: MainVC, context: Context) {
    }
}

```

that's it. that's the entire app.

- no clue if [this thing](https://a.co/d/fkkYqNX) has a gpio led or not blink sketch doesnt work

for new project
- get_idf
- idf.py set-target esp32
