- trying to use Pine64's ESP 01S + their USB programmer
- also Pine64 BL602 EVB


quickstart:
---


- set the switch on either to H
- plug it in to computer (should be in programming mode now)
- export sketch binary with arduinoide (then click show project folder)
- use blfash to upload the program

from here 
```
https://pine64.github.io/bl602-docs/Quickstart_Guide/connecting_the_hardware.html#connecting-the-hardware
```

- it says success but i don't see a blinking led 
- idk how to program it with the arduino ide, it just keeps doing the `Connecting... ___ ... ` thing till it times out
