using inventor to refine a 3d scan from the TrueDepth camera on an iPhone XS using Heges


for some reason you need to download this random Add In and enable it in Inventor
```
https://apps.autodesk.com/INVNTOR/en/Detail/Index?id=6950391119076900441&appLang=en&os=Win64
```

now you can right click on the mesh in a new part and click "convert to base feature", change it to Solid/Surface and click ok
