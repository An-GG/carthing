ts works but you need to put these old zip libraries from 
```
web.archive.org/https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/TFT_Touch_Shield_V1.0/res/TFT_TouchScreen_for_Arduino_1.0.zip
```

(which is from)
```
https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/TFT_Touch_Shield_V1.0/
```


put them in C:/User/ankua/Documents/Arduino/libraries/*

in TFT/TFT.h , replace WProgram.h with Arduino
